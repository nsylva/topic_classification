    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "ANSWER:  \n",
    "**Question 4:** Why doesn't k-Nearest Neighbors work well for this problem?  \n",
    "k-Nearest Neighbors has difficulties with data with many dimensions. In this context of classifying documents using a large vocabulary (28,879 words), training points tend to be very far from each other, making the similarity between documents vague. \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Question 5:** Why doesn't Logistic Regression work as well as Naive Bayes does?  \n",
    "Logistic regression is capturing the increase in odds of a document belonging to a certain class based on unit increases in the count of specific words in the vocabulary. In contrast, Naive Bayes is looking at the posterior probabilities of each class given the counts of words directly. In my interpretation, this transfers more fluently to the problem given the size of the vocabulary. Because of the size of the vocabulary, there is necessarily 28,880 coefficients (vocab size + 1 for the intercept), which are collectively very small and individually do not contribute much to classification.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Question 6:** What is the relationship between logistic regression's sum of squared weights vs. C value?  \n",
    "Regularization helps shrink weights that are too large. The larger the C value, the smaller the amount of regularization that goes into the model. With less regularization, the weights tend to be larger, boosting the value of the sum of squared weights."

    "### Part 6:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. Logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small total size. The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as in Part 3 above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. Whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives many of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "For several L1 regularization strengths ...<br/>\n",
    "* Produce a Logistic Regression model using the **L1** regularization strength.  Reduce the vocabulary to only those features that have at least one non-zero weight.  Produce a new Logistic Regression model using the reduced vocabulary and **L2** regularization strength of 0.5.  Evaluate and show the L1 regularization strength, vocabulary size, and f1 score associated with the new model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Show a plot of f1 score vs. log vocabulary size.  Each point corresponds to a specific L1 regularization strength used to reduce the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does performance of the models based on reduced vocabularies compare to that of a model based on the full vocabulary?\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., penalty=\"l1\")` to produce a logistic regression model using L1 regularization.\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., penalty=\"l2\")` to produce a logistic regression model using L2 regularization.\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., tol=0.015)` to produce a logistic regression model using relaxed gradient descent convergence criteria.  The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.015 (the default is .0001)."

    "ANSWER:  \n",
    "The baseline model with a full vocabulary (size = 26879) on these data returned an F1 score of 0.697. For the reduced vocabularies, F1 scores were lower the smaller the vocabulary. Very small regularization strengths (high values of C) produced vocabularies near in size to the full vocabulary and produced similar (F1 = 0.689; C = 2500; vocab size = 26663) or higher (F1 = 0.702; C = 5000; vocab size = 28802). Unsurprisingly, extremely high degrees of regularization, e.g., C = 0.005, which produces a regularization strength of 200, limits the vocabulary for the L2 model to such a degree that the model is rendered useless (F1 score: 0.137; vocab size **12 words**). \n"

    "`CountVectorizer` uses counts of words in a given document, essentially how often the words occur, or document term frequency. `TfidfVectorizer` uses a combination of term frequency and inverse document frequency (IDF), which scores words that appear less often higher than words that appear often. For example, \"the\" is a very common word both in terms of how often it occurs in a document and over many documents. In contrast, the word \"erudite\" is certainly much less common both in terms of the number of times it would be included in a document and the number of documents it is contained in. Looking at these specific words, a corpus of documents would generate higher TFIDF scores for \"erudite\" than \"the\" because \"erudite\" is less common and seen as more important.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The $R$ value provides a metric for detecting how well the classifier picks up on the correct terms in a document. A perfect score is 1 assuming that the classifer chooses the label based on the maximum probability class. Higher $R$ scores indicate the correct terms relative to a given class are not being used to make the classification because the classfiier assigns a higher probability to the incorrect class. In the context of our three highest $R$ values:  \n",
    "1. The correct label for the Rank 1 $R$ value (929.36) was talk.religion.misc but the classifier predicted that it would be comp.graphics. Evaluating it as a human reader, this specific example talks a lot about computer-related terms such as FTP, connect, cd pub, ASCII, etc. The example reads as instructions for performing a computer task though the context is all about religion. The classifier picked up on the computer-related words instead of the important, contextual words (Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith Story).\n",
    "2. The correct label for the Rank 2 $R$ value (325) was talk.religion.misc. Similar to the Rank 1 $R$ value, it was also predicted to be comp.graphics. The content of the text is related to the same subject matter as the Rank 1 R value post: the online text of The Book of Mormon. Key phrases the classifier likely picked up on include: ftp, site, online, email, internet, address.\n",
    "3. The correct label for the Rank 3 $R$ value (278.18) was alt.atheism but the classifier predicted it would be talk.religion.misc. This entry is only 26 words long and most of the words are relatively neutral (in my human interpretation) when it comes to determining if the post is about religion or atheisim. If provided the same categories for choosing a label for this post, I would be guessing. The post reads more like a news story. It is possible that somewhere in the training data there is a post (or many) relating to some of the key words in this post, killed, fired, gunman, and children, which caused the classifier to assign a much greater probability to religion than atheism.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Relaxing some of the regularization to increase the vocabulary of the model might help fix these issues. Additionally, if there were a way to add contextual information such as part of speech tagging or perhaps topical context information for individual words, the classifier might have an easier time with the confusing cases presented here."
